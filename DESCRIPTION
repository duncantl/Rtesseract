Package: Rtesseract
Title: Interface to the tesseract OCR system
Description: This provides a flexible Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 
  facility via the tesseract C++ library.
  This allows us to read text from images. It also allows us to analyze
  the results and possible errors in the recognition.
  We can do data analysis on the errors, if we know the truth, and 
  explore how we may improve the recognition.
  It also provides some functionality from the leptonica library for
  performing image processing. This allows us, for example, to detect
  lines in an image, important for interpreting tables.
